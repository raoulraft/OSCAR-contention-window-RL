# OSCAR: a Contention Window Optimization approach using Deep Reinforcement Learning
OSCAR: a Contention Window Optimization approach using Deep Reinforcement Learning to quickly learn the optimal policies under different network conditions

### Requisites
A working ```ns3-gym``` environment is required.
Moreover, a ```wandb``` account is required to show the results.

### Installation 
Clone this repository so that it lands inside ns3-gym/scratch/linear-mesh

### Start training 
Launch ```python OSCAR_train.py``` to train the OSCAR algorithm.

Launch ```python CCOD_train.py``` to train the CCOD algorithm.

Launch ```python standard_test_and_ccod_train.py``` to test the 802.11 algorithm and train the CCOD algorithm.
